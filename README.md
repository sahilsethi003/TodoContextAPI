# React Todo Application with Context API & LocalStorage

A clean and interactive Todo application built with React, demonstrating modern frontend development practices. This project allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with a user-friendly interface styled using Tailwind CSS.

It showcases core React concepts including:
*   State management with `useState` and the Context API (`TodoProvider`).
*   Component-based architecture (`App`, `TodoForm`, `TodoItem`).
*   Side effects management with `useEffect` for persisting todos to the browser's `localStorage`.
*   Handling user input and events for a dynamic experience.

## Features

*   **Create Todos:** Easily add new tasks to your list.
*   **Read Todos:** View all your current tasks in a clear layout.
*   **Update Todos:**
    *   Mark todos as complete or incomplete.
    *   (If implemented in `TodoItem`) Edit the text of existing todos.
*   **Delete Todos:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** Your todos are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the browser tab or refresh the page.
*   **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a good experience across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** (v18+) For building the user interface with components and hooks.
    *   **React Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`.
    *   **React Context API:** For global state management of todos.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core programming language.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure.
*   **Browser `localStorage` API:** For client-side data persistence.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into logical components:

*   `App.js`: The main application component, responsible for overall layout, state logic, and context provision.
*   `./Components/TodoForm.js`: Component for the input form to add new todos.
*   `./Components/TodoItem.js`: Component to display individual todo items and handle interactions like toggle complete and delete.
*   `./Context/Index.js` (and related context files): Manages the `TodoContext` and `TodoProvider` for sharing state and functions across the component tree.
*   `App.css`: For any global styles or Tailwind CSS base/component configurations.
